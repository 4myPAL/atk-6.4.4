atk-6.4.4
=========

atk-6.4.4 from Achievo-1.4.5 distribution

This repo is for temporary use as a sub-module by the GitHub atkphpframework/achievo project until the atk project repo is available. Once the atk project repo is available, the achievo repo will instead use atk-6.4.4 from the atk repo as a sub-module, and then this repo will be removed.
